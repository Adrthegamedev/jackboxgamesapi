A simple script that uses the jackbox ecast server to make a playable game. I do not own every party pack, but if possible, it would be great to have more appTags. 
The app tag can be found in jbg.config.jet in the games directory

# How To Use
make an instance of the host() class and input an appTag. Use the appTags enum.
